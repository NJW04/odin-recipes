# odin-recipes
My first project using HTML.
This project aims to create a recipe webiste which will have links which takes the user to those recipe pages.
The current recipes are lasagna, fried chicken and air fried hotdogs.
On each recipe page there is a photo of the finished product, required ingredients and the steps needed to make the dish.
